- Develop a smart water system that integrates novel high-frequency sensors, cyberinfrastructure, and ecosystem forecasting techniques to improve the management of drinking water supply lakes and reservoirs;

- Assess public perception of the adoption and use of environmental sensor networks by utilities to improve drinking water quality;

- And create a curriculum that teaches students how to analyze, visualize, and interpret data emerging from smart and connected (S&C) technologies.
